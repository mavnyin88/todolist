# Tab Bar Controller with a UITableView example

## To Do List App
-I wanted to learn how to make a Tab Bar and a UITableView so I made a basic to do list app.
-I also wanted to learn how to change the cell background and text color.
  -If the cell row number is odd its a darker blue and orange text
  -If the cell row number is even its a ligther blue and white text
-You can use the "Second" tab to add to the current list
-You can use swipe to delete anything from the list
